** GreTree it's a simple bash script that shows random directory and random file in it. **

I use this script every time when i open terminal, just type /path/to/greet.sh in your bash/zsh config)

You can change showing directory when replace "~/" in first line to another path as you want!
* In next time i will realize showing images and run audio files. *

REQUIES:
- tree
